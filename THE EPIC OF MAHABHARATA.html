            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. It narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins in the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes and their successors.</p>

                â€” About the Mahabharata's comprehensiveness
            </div>
            
            <p>With over 100,000 shlokas (couplets) and about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is the longest epic poem in the world. It includes philosophical and devotional material, such as the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="authorship">
            <h2>Authorship</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to the sage Vyasa. The full version of the text was likely compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE.</p>
            <p>Vyasa is also a character in the epic, being the grandfather of both the Pandavas and Kauravas.</p>
